# HDL Development Guidelines (VHDL & Verilog)

This document provides best practices and configuration tips for HDL development, focusing on VHDL and Verilog. Our currently used IDE is Vivado, but Visual Studio Code (VS Code) with TerosHDL extension is preferred for enhanced code formatting, linting, and version control.

> [!NOTE]
> This guide is a work in progress and still needs further development and improvement.

## 1. VHDL Naming Conventions

VHDL is case-insensitive, which often leads to inconsistent code styles. To maintain readability and consistency:

- Use a code formatter and linter, such as [VSG](https://github.com/jeremiah-c-leary/vhdl-style-guide).
- Default to lowercase for identifiers.
- Use uppercase ("shouting case") for constants.

## 2. VS Code Configuration

### Git Version Control

See appendix for the .gitignore file to exclude files generated by Vivado.

### Recommended Extension: TerosHDL

[TerosHDL](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=teros-technology.teroshdl) adds essential features to VS Code, including:

- Advanced formatting and linting
- Simulation, synthesis, and implementation support
- Improved code navigation

> [!CAUTION]
> - Relative paths are not fully supported for configs and external programs.
> - Integration with Vivado and other tools on Windows may require manual environment setup. See [Issue 778](https://github.com/TerosTechnology/vscode-terosHDL/issues/778).
